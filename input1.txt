Salem[5] is an ancient, mysterious figure from Remnant's forgotten past and the primary antagonist of RWBY.

She is one of the few who possesses the power of Magic, and the master of the Grimm. She is also highly knowledgeable, cunning and manipulative.

She is the leader of a cabal of people with malicious plans and operates out of Evernight Castle in the Land of Darkness. Her goals are to find the Maidens and use their powers to obtain the Relics from the Huntsman Academies.

She was a part of the original Humanity, before being cursed with immortality and falling into a Grimm Pool. She was married to Ozma before their ideologies tore them apart making them mortal enemies.

In "War", it is revealed that the reason she intends on dividing Humanity is so that when the Relics are brought together, The Gods will destroy Remnant and in turn, break the curse on her allowing her to die.

She is the protagonist of The Girl in the Tower, a Fairy Tale which details her early life.[6]

In "Ruby Rose", the first episode of the series, Salem serves as the narrator, giving the opening voice-over for the series, but credited only as "Mysterious Narrator" in "Black and White" and "Breach" until her first on-screen appearance in the Volume 3 finale, "End of the Beginning". She is also the narrator of the first four RWBY: World of Remnant episodes.
